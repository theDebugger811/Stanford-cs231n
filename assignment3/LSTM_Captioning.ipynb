    "If you read recent papers, you'll see that many people use a variant on the vanilla RNN called Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) RNNs. Vanilla RNNs can be tough to train on long sequences due to vanishing and exploding gradients caused by repeated matrix multiplication. LSTMs solve this problem by replacing the simple update rule of the vanilla RNN with a gating mechanism as follows.\n",

The learnable parameters of the LSTM are an *input-to-hidden* matrix $W_x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{4H\\times D}$, a *hidden-to-hidden* matrix $W_h\\in\\mathbb{R}^{4H\\times H}$ and a *bias vector* $b\\in\\mathbb{R}^{4H}$.\n",
