    "# Fully-connected nets with Dropout\n",
    "In the file `cs231n/classifiers/fc_net.py`, modify your implementation to use dropout. Specifically, if the constructor of the net receives a value that is not 1 for the `dropout` parameter, then the net should add dropout immediately after every ReLU nonlinearity. After doing so, run the following to numerically gradient-check your implementation."
